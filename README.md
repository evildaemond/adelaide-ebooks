## Story

I wanted to download the collection of the adelaide ebooks archive one night after seeing how many classic books they had, it wasn't an open directory like I was use to, I could not just `wget -r` the site so I had to get creative, I asked some help from a friend, and we got together and wrote this pretty well, I kind of forgot about it, and then I migrated OS and then my drive died that had the source, and I got it back up like a week ago, and it was uncommented and disgusting. I rewrote some of it and tried to improve upon it, it seems to work well right now, runs on my box and all that jazz.
